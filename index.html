				<h3>Come be apart of history</h3>
				<p>Kasbahs are fortified structures or citadels found primarily in North Africa, especially Morocco. They were built by the Amazigh (Berber) people using materials like clay and stone. Historically, kasbahs served as defensive strongholds and residences for powerful families or tribal leaders. Today, many have been converted into hotels or tourist attractions, showcasing their rich architectural and cultural heritage.</p>
